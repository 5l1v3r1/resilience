Resilience is an ad blocker for your computer that works with **any browser** on **any operating system**.

Resilience doesn't sell out your privacy with *"acceptable ads"*. Resilience won't be blocked by your web browser's developers. Resilience won't ever stop defending your privacy and your right to block ads on your goddamn computer.

**Resilience is currently in early alpha!** test, contribute, suggest fixes and improvements! The goal is to get it to a state where it's just as easy to use as uBlock.
